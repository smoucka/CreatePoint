#####CreatePoint
===========
#####Simple Python class for creating a point within a provided bounding box.

This little number was created for several reasons.

* The ever confounding and always changing ArcGIS license I have at work suddenly does not provide some of the most basic tools i.e. generate random points.
* While not new to Python I do not have a formal programming background and I've never written my own class before. Whether this situation calls for such a construction I cannot say but it was fun to write it.
* I searched the Indianapolis municipal site for any downloadable GIS content to somewhat mimic population dot density for a simple example map. No such luck. I resorted to generating my own points with this code.
